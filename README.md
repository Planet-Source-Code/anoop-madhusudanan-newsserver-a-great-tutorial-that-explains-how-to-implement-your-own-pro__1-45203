<b>WHY THIS ARTICLE?<br>
</b><br>
To teach you how to design session layer protocols like HTTP and FTP<br>
(if you are interested ;) ).<br>
<br>
Read Readme.htm with this package for a better overview.<br>
<br>
The zip file contains 3 projects<br>
<br>
a) NewsServer - This project<br>
b) I-News GUI client - A client with a GUI (in the ClientGUI folder)<br>
c) I-News Client - A telnet like client (in the Client folder)<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>WHAT IS THIS!!!<br>
</b><br>
I-News server is a TCP/IP based server suit, with limited functionality to<br>
serve news over a network. Rather than working as a news server, this application<br>
is to demonstrate the designing and implementation of of custom application protocols<br>
over TCP/IP. This package contains the Server in the server directory,<br>
along with two clients. In the folder ClientGUI, there is a visual client,<br>
and in the folder Client, there is a simple text based client.<br>
